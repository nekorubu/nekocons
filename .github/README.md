# Nekocons

Moved repo to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nekobu/nekocons). Go check it out (and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/)) there.

~~Might rename this in the future~~

This is a personal fork of the Lawnchair Team's Lawnicons. It adds icons for apps that I use, most of which are taken from the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com).
